# Quick Structures and Algorithms

Data Structures provide us a convenient way of storing and handling data into our project. With the absence of inbuilt data structure developers usually face problems

This Package is aimed to provide users quick strucures and algorithms at their finger tips

*Latest Version* - 1.0.1 

For now this Package includes

1. LinkedList
2. Graph
3. Binary Tree
4. Maps
5. Queue
6. Stacks
7. Set
8. Vectors
9. Matrix

**__Implementation of other structures follow the same pattern__**

# Algorithms

Algortihms for most of the data structures are included in the package like

1. BFS
2. Sorting
3. Min/Max
4. Nodes Count
5. Depth

*If you Liked the package dont foroget to leave behin a star :)*
